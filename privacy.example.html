<h2>Data collected when browsing the database</h2>

<p>When you access any page of this website, your web browser transmits the following information to the server:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your IP address
<li>The version number of your web browser and operating system
<li>In some cases, the website you were browsing before visiting this website
</ul>

<p>Together with information about which pages were accessed and any errors that occurred during that access, this information is stored temporarily (no longer than [RETENTION PERIOD HERE]) for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>To identify and prevent abuse (for example, to identify denial-of-service attacks originating from an IP address)
<li>To diagnose and fix problems with the website
</ul>

<h2>Data collected when contributing</h2>

<p>This database is a public, collaborative effort. By submitting a contribution, you are choosing to make it public. As such, it is your responsibility not to include personal data in your contribution which you do not wish to be public.</p>

<p>This database requires you to sign in with your GitHub account in order to contribute. Signing in is used to attribute your contributions to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your contributions are <strong>publicly attributed to your GitHub username</strong>
<li>Moderation actions may be informed by your contribution history and identity
</ul>

<p>When you sign in with GitHub, only the following information will be collected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your GitHub username
<li>Your GitHub account's unique ID number (so you can still be recognised if you change your username)
</ul>

<p>If you do not make any contributions, then this information is only stored for as long as you remain signed in, plus a short period of time after this while it awaits deletion (no longer than [RETENTION PERIOD HERE]). If you do make a contribution, then your GitHub username and GitHub account ID number will be stored in the database, and your GitHub username will be publicly displayed alongside your contributions. If all of your contributions are deleted, then your GitHub username and account ID number are removed from the database.</p>

<p>If you have changed your GitHub username, signing in will update the publicly displayed username on your past contributions.</p>

<p>A <strong>cookie will be set</strong> when you sign in. This cookie is only used for the attribution described above.</p>

<p>Please note that signing in with GitHub also involves the processing of your data by GitHub, which has a separate privacy policy.</p>
